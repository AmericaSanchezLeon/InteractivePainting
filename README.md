# InteractivePainting

Final project of the master's degree class "interactive media" <br/>
In this project Leonora Carrington’s painting “Grandmother Moorhead’s aromatic kitchen” was was intervened to create a interactive physical painting.<br/><br/>

Through image processing with OpenCV, the program identifies the color of some determinated elements related to kitchen an cooking, and when these elements are showed in the camera, the painting responds with some movement of the characters or the lighting of some elements.<br/><br/>

Using Processing and p5.js as mediator between OpenCV and Arduino, when a stablished color range signal was received, an action was sent to an Arduino uno board and this one triggered a led or servo, that was placed carefully to simulate the activy the character would be doing.<br/><br/>
